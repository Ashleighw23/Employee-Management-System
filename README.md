# Employee-Management-System

# Description 
I used node, javascript, Inquirer and MYSQL to develop a employee tracker that allows a company to interact with information stored in the databases, through a command line application. You can view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company so you can organize and plan your business. You will also be able to update employee roles, ids, salary, and add new managers.

Here is a link to a walk through video to be able to see how the command-line works (will add link)

Here is a link to my github repo https://github.com/Ashleighw23/Employee-Management-System.git


# Instructions

When you start the command-line application, you will be asked "What you want to do?". Then you can enter view, update or employee. Depending on what you want to do, it will then ask you the required questions in order to see or update the Employee Table.
